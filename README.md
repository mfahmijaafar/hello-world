# hello-world
trying to create a repo
So when I edit this readme, it wont be shown on the main branch, unless I merge it. For now, it will only show on the 'readme-edit' branch.
Ok, so after I did the update, I should click on commit and the pull request. I once again will accept the request to merge the update with the old file & later on delete the update branch. That was what I did.
